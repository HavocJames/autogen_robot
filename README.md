a robot that is powered by large language models and autogen as well as langchain tools
(it should be noted that  the  robot is controlled through the function act where the it sends strings of command to the microcontroller where the action is enabled )

# ABSTRACT 
LLM-based Humanoid Robot represents a pioneering exploration into the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) within humanoid robotics, aiming to revolutionize human-robot interaction.
With the focus lies on developing a sophisticated AI Voice interactive robot assistant that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to create a seamless and intuitive interface between humans and robots. 
The primary objectives are to provide accurate and relevant responses when users seek directions or information through natural language understanding and to handle errors and recovery
effectively. 
This project provides a hands-free, instinctive interface, empowering users to navigate effortlessly through voice commands. Key to our approach is the deployment of a 21 Degree of Freedom (DOF) humanoid robot, serving as the physical embodiment of our LLM-based Humanoid Robot.
Equipped with cutting-edge hardware and software components, this robot embodies the fusion of artificial intelligence and robotics, offering users a natural and instinctive means of communication through voice commands. 
Central to the system's functionality is the utilization of LLM as the brain of the robot ensures rapid processing of user commands and responses, while also prioritizing data privacy and security. 
This approach enables the robot to tap into a vast knowledge base, providing accurate and relevant information to users in real time. 
Furthermore, the system incorporates advanced speech recognition and synthesis technologies, facilitating fluid dialogue between humans and the robot. 
Through sophisticated dialogue management techniques using chains and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from a local database, the robot can handle errors effectively and adapt its responses to suit the user's needs. 
The importance of this project lies in its potential to enhance accessibility, enabling a broader user base to interact with technology naturally.
It offers a significant time-saving solution, adapts to emerging technologies, and boosts efficiency and productivity By creating an efficient and user-friendly interface and exploring the full potential of LLM-based humanoid robots across various domains, including healthcare assistance, entertainment companionship, and beyond. The aim is to enhance accessibility and broaden the scope of human-robot interaction. Ultimately, this project contributes to the advancement of robotics technology, paving the way for a future where humanoid robots play an integral role in everyday life
